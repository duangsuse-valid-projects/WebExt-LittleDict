Comparing to projects above:

+ We have GPLv3 license (so don't copy our code to close-source distributions)
+ We have recursive generic-typed ES6 `Map<K,V>` based [triedata.ts](src/triedata.ts) that supports "lazy `Map` creating", "inword grep" as tokenizer backend
+ We are not developing a new input method(IME), the "IME" feature is just a temporary replacement
+ Non-GUI side optimizing&code quality/simplicity is seen more important than packaging
+ Solving a general problem is seen better than solving a special case
+ Just commit simplest, minimal, reasonable code required to implement a feature in this project
+ Issues&contributions in any (language/culture)s are welcome <3
